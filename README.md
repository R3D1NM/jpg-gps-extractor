## Image GPS information parser
- get GPS info from jpg(jpeg) files
- get datetime of the images (time when the photo taken, not creation time)
- export the extracted information as metadata.csv
- pin where the photos taken on the map and mark with datetime
- connect the pins with the same date
- export the map as a html file (image_gps_map_with_route.html)
